## How to apply this license to your Flight Fare Prediction project

1. Save this file as `LICENSE` at the root of your project repository.
2. Add the following license header to the top of each source file or notebook (e.g., `.py`, `.ipynb`):

```
# Flight Fare Prediction - (c) 2025
# Licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
```

For Jupyter notebooks, you can add the header as the first Markdown cell.

---

## Optional: `package.json` / `setup.py` metadata (example)

If your project has packaging metadata, include a license field. Example for `setup.py`:

```python
setup(
    name='flight-fare-prediction',
    version='0.1.0',
    license='MIT',
    # ...
)
```

Or `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "flight-fare-prediction",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

---

If you want, I can also:

* Add the license header into your uploaded notebook (`Project 4 - Flight Fare Prediction.ipynb`) and save a copy.
* Create a short `README.md` incorporating the license and project summary.

Tell me which you'd like and I will do it now.
